## What is ImageGlass?

**ImageGlass** is a free, open-source image viewer designed for Windows, created to be a fast, versatile, and modern replacement for the default Windows Photo Viewer. It supports a wide array of image formats—including WEBP, SVG, HEIC, RAW, and many others—that are not always natively supported in other viewers.

With its clean, user-friendly interface, ImageGlass provides a seamless and efficient way to view, organize, and perform basic edits on your images. It is particularly valued by photographers, designers, and everyday users for its speed, low resource consumption, and high degree of customization.

Whether you are managing large photo collections, quickly viewing screenshots, or needing support for niche image formats, ImageGlass delivers a reliable and enhanced viewing experience without the bloat of larger software suites.
